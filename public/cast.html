                <h4>Xavier Torres as Carlos</h4>
                <p>
                  Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Xavier Torres began his career at age 15 working as talent material for commercials and publicity campaigns. As his popularity and interest in the entertainment industry grew, he became impelled to take on acting as a profession. Torres moved to Miami in hopes of expanding his opportunities. Once there, he booked roles in the feature films "Quiéreme Mucho" and "La Cocina", and also starred in Telemundo's original series "Decisiones" that played in Latin America. In 2006 he got his first chance to enter the Anglo-Saxon market with a starring role in the Lifetime Television Network movie Break In. In it he plays "Angel", a young thief that kidnaps a group of tourists who were on vacation in the Caribbean. Here, Xavier worked alongside Kelly Carlson of the popular TV series Nip/Tuck and the well-known Latin actor and singer Carlos Ponce. His performance in Break In opened up great opportunities and the interest of Hollywood agents and managers began to rise. During this process, Xavier auditioned and obtained a part in the acclaimed HBO original series Entourage, becoming the first Latin actor to take part in the show. He played the role of "Javier Gracho", a dreamy soap opera actor who has a romantic scene with "Mrs. Ari", Emmy and Golden Globe Award winner Jeremy Piven's on-screen wife, interpreted by Perry Reeves. In his latest work, the Disney Channel's Emmy Award winning Original TV Series': Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie, he worked alongside the highly acclaimed actress Selena Gomez, David Henrie, and Jake T. Austin. In the movie, Xavier plays "Javier", a windsurfing instructor who tries to charm "Alex" while she's on vacation with her family. The movie was the most watched telecast of 2009 with 11.4 million viewers on opening night and the second most viewed Disney movie after High School Musical 2. Xavier Torres stands out, not only because of his talent, but also with the versatility of his image and style. So much so that he was selected to appear on the cover of TIME Magazine's May 29, 2009 issue representing "The Future of Work" feature article. His fresh personality and his steadfast determination guarantee his successful future. He was recognized as Hollywood's new "Latin Hunk" by the New York Daily News and was selected as one of the "50 Most Beautiful" by Cosmopolitan magazine. Xavier Torres steadily continues breaking through and positioning himself as a prominent actor, both in the Latin American and Anglo-Saxon markets. Torres belongs to the prestigious management company Luber Roklin Entertainment who also represents actors Jaime Presley, Paul Walker, Roselyn Sánchez, among others

                  include me in his process of songwriting and would invite me to contribute in his songs since I was a boy,” he remembers. Currently he is looking forward to the premiere of the film “Paraiso Travel.” The film is directed by Simon Brand,
                  co-starring John Leguizamo. Participating in all of these projects forced Capó to take a break from his compositions, but it also planted a seed in him to love acting.

                    Capó, born Pedro Capó, has an inherent great love for music. Born in the land of his ancestors, San Juan, Puerto Rico, he lived a life of bohemian inspirations. Grandson of the brilliant Puerto Rican singer/songwriter Bobby Capó, renown melodist and singer
                    of the 1940’s and son of the unforgettable singer and cultivator of the trova and salsa Bobby Capó, this young singer/songwriter is the third generation member of a family tradition that has left its stamp in Latin music. “My dad would
                    include me in his process of songwriting and would invite me to contribute in his songs since I was a boy,” he remembers. Currently he is looking forward to the premiere of the film “Paraiso Travel.” The film is directed by Simon Brand,
                    co-starring John Leguizamo. Participating in all of these projects forced Capó to take a break from his compositions, but it also planted a seed in him to love acting.

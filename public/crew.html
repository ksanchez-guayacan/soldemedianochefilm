          Douglas Pedro Sánchez (born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on September 30, 1952), known as Douglas Sánchez, is a Puerto Rican film director and screenwriter.
          <br> In 1980 he produced and directed a feature-length film titled Cualquier Cosa (Anything), which won a Special Achievement Award from the Mexican Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences.
          <br> In recent years, Sánchez has written three feature-film scripts: Anacobero (Daniel Santos’ Last tour), based on the chronicle-novel Vengo a decirle adiós a los muchachos by Puerto Rican author Josean Ramos, La Perla del Caribe (The Pearl
          of the Caribbean) based on an original idea, and Sol de Medianoche (Midnight Sun), based on the detective-novel of the same title by Puerto Rican author Edgardo Rodríguez-Juliá, which is currently in pre-production.

              Capó, born Pedro Capó, has an inherent great love for music. Born in the land of his ancestors, San Juan, Puerto Rico, he lived a life of bohemian inspirations. Grandson of the brilliant Puerto Rican singer/songwriter Bobby Capó, renown melodist and singer
              of the 1940’s and son of the unforgettable singer and cultivator of the trova and salsa Bobby Capó, this young singer/songwriter is the third generation member of a family tradition that has left its stamp in Latin music. “My dad would include
              me in his process of songwriting and would invite me to contribute in his songs since I was a boy,” he remembers. Currently he is looking forward to the premiere of the film “Paraiso Travel.” The film is directed by Simon Brand, co-starring
              John Leguizamo. Participating in all of these projects forced Capó to take a break from his compositions, but it also planted a seed in him to love acting.

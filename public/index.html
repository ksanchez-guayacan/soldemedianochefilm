            <h3>Synopsis of Sol de Medianoche</h3>
            <p>
              Manolo is a specialized detective in cases of adultery, cases he often trie to subdue as two sided business: that is, at the request of one of the victims takes pictures and records videos in the act of adulterous couples then also sent to the other victim in a monetarily attempt to exploit both parties.
              <br>
              Aspect and bohemian habits, Manolo lives in a guest house known as 'The Hospitalillo', located in a seedy tourist-beach neighborhood, where it is surrounded by a quasi-community of veterans deranged war, gigolos, prostitutes, thugs, ex -presidiarios, alcoholics, drug dealers and addicts, including her friend and confidant Nadja and her apparent object of desire, the dancer Aurora nuyorican.
              <br>
              Above all, Manolo lives tortured by the murder of his twin brother Frank, an event in which he was involved but whose circumstances seems to remember or to explain for being intoxicated. Manolo always lived in the shadow of the charismatic Frank, favorite at home and at school and always successful until served five tours in Iraq and returned extremely battered. He now lives haunted by the memories of the last days of Frank who was accused of murder by unspeakable jealousy subsidiaries Cain and Abel type.
              <br>
              The film tells the seemingly lax efforts and inept Manolo to offer protection to Carlos, a friend of Frank immersed in a messy adultery - a situation that Manolo unwisely attempts to bring into their scheme with disastrous results - and their parallel efforts to rebuild mentally precise events that culminated in the murder of his twin brother.
